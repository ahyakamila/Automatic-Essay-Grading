# Automatic-Essay-Grading
In the learning process, evaluation has an important role in order to know the success of learning. There are several types of questions to evaluate learning outcomes. Essay type questions are still often used as a parameter to evaluate student learning outcomes. This is because this type of question has the advantage that it is considered to be able to represent the results of student understanding in learning. With this type of question, students cannot guess the answer choices that have been provided. However, to make an assessment on essay type questions, it takes longer time than other types of questions (multiple choice or short entry). Assessment of this type of question also requires more costs. As a result, a system was created that can automatically assess questions with the type of essay (Automated Essay Grading).
